# 極簡咖啡募資計劃

## Just using simple HTML & CSS to build a webpage to raise funds for the cafe - "極簡咖啡".

## Unfortunately, the cafe was finally closed down. 
## Although the website did not help the cafe, this "meaningless" project gives me a great sense of satisfaction. I believe that if I finally become front-end developer, I can make more and more contributions to society.

## That is the reason why I pinned this "awful" work in my github. :)
